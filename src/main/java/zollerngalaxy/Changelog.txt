===== CHANGELOG =====
Zollern Galaxy v2.0.33
=====================

** NEW **
* Added the Kriffon Villager.
    - Regular Alien Villagers will conert into Kriffon Villagers when on that planet.
* Added the Purgot Villager.
    - Regular Alien Villagers will conert into Purgot Villagers when on that planet.
* Added the next new planet, Centotl.
    - Planet is themed after LV-426 from Alien (1979). Shares similarities, but has its own take on it.
    - Random "Facehugger Eggs" spawn throughout the planet. Try interacting with one.
* Added the Facehugger Egg block.
    - Similar to the Spiderling Egg, breaking one spawns 1 to 4 of the creatures.
    - Facehuggers and Xenomorphs have the capability to hatch these eggs if they come into contact with them.
* Added the Facehugger mob.
    - Almost a one-hit K.O. if it attacks you, so exercise caution.
        - This might end up as a config option later.
    - If killed by a Facehugger, a Xenomoprh is spawned where the entity (or Player) was killed.
        - There is a 5% chance that it will be a Queen.
* Added the Xenomorph mob.
    - Usually only spawns when a Player or entity is killed by a Facehugger, but has been known to spawn elsewhere.
        - They mostly come at night. Mostly.
        - There is a 25% chance that it could be a Queen Xenomorph when an entity is killed by a Facehugger.
            - These can lay more Facehugger Eggs, each with a 25% chance to hatch immediately.
* Added the Queen Xenomorph mob.
    - This is the mod's second boss mob, and is by far the deadliest ever added. Serious firepower will be required.
        - Probably best to nuke it from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.
