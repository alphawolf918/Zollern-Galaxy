===== CHANGELOG =====
Zollern Galaxy v2.0.35
=====================

[NEW]
* Added two new planets: Toci - planet of the Wanderers, and Tlaloc, the robotic planet.
* Added the Wanderer mob to Toci.
    - At night, they have a danger meter which increases as the night goes on.
        - If this meter gets too high, they will build a "home" if they do not have one already.
            - This is turned off by default in the config, and Wanderers themselves can be turned off as well.
* Added Vexbots to Tlaloc.
    - Spawn Radiolaria (White Lava) when they die (can be disabled in config).
    - Can't we stay here with the murderous robots?
* Added the Vexbot Boss.
    - Similar to the regular Vexbot, but much bigger, faster, and stronger.
    - Only appears in Tlaloc Dungeons.
* Added Tlaloc Dungeons to Tlaloc. These spawn hundreds of blocks away from each other, awaiting with rewards.
    - This is the mod's first attempt at a boss dungeon; please report any bugs or issues.
* Added the Toci, Perdita, Tlaloc and Oasis Villagers.
* Added the Galaxy Dragon mob, akin to a Baby Ender Dragon. This mob is tameable using a bone.
    - You can also tempt it / make it breed by giving it a Lost Peach or a Lost Berry.
    - At this time, they cannot be ridden, but that is planned for the future.
    - These do not spawn naturally, and instead, they spawn when the Dragon Egg is broken.
        - Obtained after fighting the Ender Dragon.
* Added a stack increase helper for Saddles, Ender Pearls, Signs, Buckets and Snowballs from 16 to 64.
    - This can be disabled in the config.
* Added Plutonium and Fueltonium Ingots as solid fuel for Extreme Reactors.
* Added new Enrichment Dust item as a Circuit Fabricator recipe.
    - Used to 'enrich' certain items via different types of recipes, usually used in conjunction with other mods.
    - Will have some use in this mod as well.
* Added new Induction Smelter (Thermal Expansion) Recipe: 2 Cyanite Ingots + 2 Enrichment Dust = 2 Blutonium Ingots.
    - Extreme Reactors will need to be present for this to work, and the compatibility config option will need to be set to true.
* Added new Crafting Recipe: 1 Poisonous Potato + 1 Enrichment Dust = 2 Regular Potatoes.
    - The increase in output is to make up for the "bad luck" of getting a poisonous crop.
* Added new Induction Smelter recipe (for Thermal Foundation compat).
    - 1 Coal + 2 Enrichment Dust = 2 Super Charged Coal.
* Added random, small crater spawns to Tlaloc. Who knows how deep they go?
    - Chance to spawn can be modified in config file or disabled altogether by setting it to 0.
* Added UFO generation with a chest inside of it and up to 4 Vexbots can spawn.
* Added Mech Trees to Tlaloc.
    - Everything is chrome in the FFUUUUTTTUUURRRREEEE!
* Added Battle Towers with Mob Spawners and Treasure Chests to Oasis.
* 

[CHANGES]
* Slightly increased strength of Facehugger.
* Updated Wasp model, texture and behavior.
* Greatly increased burn time of Super Charged Coal.
* Modified some spawn rates, chances and min/max heights of certain generations on Eden.
* Enhanced custom villager replacements.
* 

[FIXES]
* Fixed Xenomorph Queen laying 'ghost eggs' on server-side.
* Fixed the Arcon mob looking and acting derpy.
* Fixed missing texture block by removing it; was only meant to be there as a test.
* Fixed Centotl Space Station registration typos.
* Fixed server crash issues with Bedrock Breaker and Radiance items.
    - These have been moved from LivingUpdateEvent to PlayerTickEvent.
