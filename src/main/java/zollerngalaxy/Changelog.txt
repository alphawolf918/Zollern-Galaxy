===== CHANGELOG =====
Zollern Galaxy v2.0.35
=====================

[NEW]
* Added two new planets: Toci - planet of the Wanderers, and Tlaloc, the robotic planet.
* Added the Wanderer mob to Toci.
    - At night, they have a danger meter which increases as the night goes on.
        - If this meter gets too high, they will build a "home" if they do not have one already.
            - This is turned off by default in the config, and Wanderers themselves can be turned off as well.
* Added the Toci, Perdita and Tlaloc Villagers.
* Added the Galaxy Dragon mob, akin to a Baby Ender Dragon. This mob is tameable using a bone.
    - You can also tempt it / make it breed by giving it a Lost Peach or a Lost Berry.
    - At this time, they cannot be ridden, but that is planned for the future.
    - These do not spawn naturally, and instead, they spawn when the Dragon Egg is broken.
        - Obtained after fighting the Ender Dragon.
* Added a stack increase helper for Saddles, Ender Pearls, Signs, Buckets and Snowballs from 16 to 64.
    - This can be disabled in the config.
* Added Plutonium and Fueltonium Ingots as solid fuel for Extreme Reactors.
* Added new Enrichment Dust item as a Circuit Fabricator recipe.
    - Used to 'enrich' certain items via different types of recipes, usually used in conjunction with other mods.
    - Will have some use in this mod as well.
* Added new Induction Smelter (Thermal Expansion) Recipe: 2 Cyanite Ingots + 2 Enrichment Dust = 2 Blutonium Ingots.
    - Extreme Reactors will need to be present for this to work, and the compatibility config option will need to be set to true.
* Added new Crafting Recipe: 1 Poisonous Potato + 1 Enrichment Dust = 2 Regular Potatoes.
    - The increase in output is to make up for the "bad luck" of getting a poisonous crop.
* 

[CHANGES]
* Slightly increased strength of Facehugger.
* Updated Wasp model, texture and behavior.
* Greatly increased burn time of Super Charged Coal.

[FIXES]
* Fixed Xenomorph Queen laying 'ghost eggs' on server-side.
* Fixed the Arcon mob looking and acting derpy.
* Removed missing texture block, was only meant to be there as a test.
*
