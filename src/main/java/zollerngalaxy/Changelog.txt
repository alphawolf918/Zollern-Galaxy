===== CHANGELOG =====
Zollern Galaxy v2.0.33
=====================

** NEW **
* Added the Kriffon Villager.
    - Regular Alien Villagers will conert into Kriffon Villagers when on that planet.
* Added the Purgot Villager.
    - Regular Alien Villagers will conert into Purgot Villagers when on that planet.
* Added the next new planet, Centotl.
    - Planet is themed after LV-426 from Alien. Shares similarities, but has its own take on it.
    - Random "Facehugger Eggs" spawn throughout the planet. Try interacting with one.
* Added the Facehugger mob.
    - Almost a one-hit K.O. if it attacks you, so exercise caution.
        - This might end up as a config option later.
    - If killed by a Facehugger, a Xenomoprh is spawned where the entity (or Player) was killed.
* Added the Xenomorph mob.
    - Usually only spawns when a Player or entity is killed by a Facehugger, but has been known to spawn elsewhere.
        - There is a chance that it could be a Queen Xenomorph.
            - These can lay more Facehugger Eggs.
