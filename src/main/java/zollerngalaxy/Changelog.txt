===== CHANGELOG =====
Zollern Galaxy v2.0.35
=====================

[NEW]
* Added the next new planet, Toci - planet of the Wanderers.
* Added the Wanderer mob to Toci.
    - At night, they have a danger meter which increases as the night goes on.
        - If this meter gets too high, they will build a "home" if they do not have one already.
            - This is turned off by default in the config, and Wanderers can be turned off as well.
* Added the Toci and Perdita Villagers.
* Added the Galaxy Dragon mob, akin to a Baby Ender Dragon. This mob is tameable using a bone.
    - You can also tempt it / make it breed by giving it a Lost Peach or a Lost Berry.
    - At this time, they cannot be ridden, but that is planned for the future.
    - These do not spawn naturally, and instead, they spawn when the Dragon Egg is broken.
        - Obtained after fighting the Ender Dragon.
* Added a stack increase helper for Saddles, Ender Pearls, Signs, Buckets and Snowballs from 16 to 64.
    - This can be disabled in the config.
